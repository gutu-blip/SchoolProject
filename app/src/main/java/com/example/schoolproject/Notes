I've been developing android apps for 2 years now and I started right after I graduated from high school. I've built and published two apps on Google Playstore, one is called Clade and the other  Ace. Essentially, Clade  is a marketplace exclusively for fashion products and doubles as a platform where people can post outfits that can serve as an inspiration for others to try whereas Ace is also a marketplace but for gigs where students who aren't employed full-time due to such factors as lacking a degree(since they're still college students) or the time to work a full time job can do some transient jobs and earn money to support themselves in college and pay for their tuition fees.Here is the link for Clade: "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilac.clade" and here is for Ace "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lilac.ace", I'm adept in Java programming language, UI/UX and I really good with firebase server
